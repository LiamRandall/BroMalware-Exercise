Bro Exchange 2013 Malware Analysis
================================

Bro is an incredibly flexible platform that offers incident responders a wide variety of detection mechanisms coupled with a powerful domain specific language. In this session we will examine common exploit kits and implement a variety of signature and heuristical based detection methods.

The military has developed a process called the OODA loop- Observe, Orient, Decide, & Act.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop

This is a useful approach to anlyzing problems in Bro; in this exercise we will be looking at traffic samples offline- which is instructive as all of the traffic in the pcaps is related to the specific sample.  In production, the task is complicated by the inclusion of "normal"  traffic.

Everyone develops their own approach to looking at logs, however I think it makes sense to begin with the 

Setup
=================================

For all of these exercises we'll be using the files hosted on my github; all malware samples are courtesy of **http://contagiodump.blogspot.com/**

First lets get all of the appropriate samples and solutions down to your VM; perform one of the following:

Download the zipfile directly down to your VM:

    https://github.com/LiamRandall/BroExchange2013-Malware/archive/master.zip

Or if you'd like to use the git repo..

If you need the cheatsheet, you can find it here: **http://tinyurl.com/l6gzuwd**

        git clone https://github.com/LiamRandall/BroExchange2013-Malware.git

Ok, so let us orient ourselves a little bit; we have eight traffic samples and handful of solutions.  As a reminder, we can replay traffic through Bro from the command line with:

        bro -r exercise.pcap scriptfile-to-load.bro


It is quite common to launch bro with "local" at the end; this will tell bro to load the local file used at normal start; in this case stored in /opt/bro/share/bro/site/local.bro
    
The two techniques may be combined.

    bro -r exercise.pcap local scriptfile-to-load.bro

Ok, one last tip before we get started... you know how to use **bro-cut** right?  Pass it a column name(s) and quickly generate power summary statistics
    
        less http.log | bro-cut user_agent resp_mime_types | sort | uniq -c | sort -n


Resources
=================================

If you are new to malware analysis or Bro, there are some wonderful resources out there to help get you up to speed.  Beyond the usual suspects, it is helpful to understand that there are common exploit kits that lead to malware deployments.  Understanding the exploits available in the various exploit kits can help to cover a lot of ground:

1-blackhole-medfos
=================================
Let's get started with a couple of warm up exercises.  Blackhole is one of the most common and frequently updated exploit kits around.  Let's see what they look like with Bro's new File Analysis Framework.

How many executable files were downloaded to the host?
    
    bro -r EK_BIN_Blackhole_leadingto_Medfos_0512E73000BCCCE5AFD2E9329972208A_2013-04.pcap 


How many executable files were downloaded?

    less files.log | grep "application" | wc -l

 What notices were fired?

        less notice.log
        
Ok, that was a pretty easy one; let's do another warm up.  Did you see the unanalyzed traffic in conn.log?  Doesn't match any protocol that Bro can speak; let's look at a couple more and we'll come back to that.

Contagio has posted an analysis of this one:

Let's look at another

=================================
The hardest part about Bro is wrapping your head around all of the various use cases- there are just an incredible number of tools at your disposal.  Did you know that Bro has a signature framework?

http://www.bro.org/sphinx/scripts/base/frameworks/signatures/main.html

Let's take a look at somethings we've got incldued right out of the box.

        bro -r Mswab_Yayih_FD1BE09E499E8E380424B3835FC973A8_2012-03.pcap local

Ok, let's use the OODA loop on this one.  


.. code:: bro

        bro -r Mswab_Yayih_FD1BE09E499E8E380424B3835FC973A8_2012-03.pcap local

What protocols are being spoken on which ports?

.. code:: bro

		less conn.log | bro-cut id.orig_h id.resp_h proto service id.resp_p | sort | uniq -c | sort -n

    .. console::
    	1 10.0.2.15	199.192.156.134	tcp	-	443
    	4 10.0.2.15	4.2.2.4	udp	dns	53
    	6 10.0.2.15	199.192.156.134	tcp	http	443

Well, http on port 443?  That's atypical.  Let's dig a little further.  What does the http traffic look like?

Now let's check the notice.log?  What is Bro trying to tell you?

Now let's check the **signature.log**.  Wow, a Windows shell tunneled over HTTP on port 443.

4-smokekt150
=================================
We have Bro identifying signatures in ports and protocols that it understands; in this example, we are going to have Bro key on a specific protocol related feature.

Let's replay the sample with Bro:

		bro -r EK_Smokekt150\(Malwaredontneedcoffee\)_2012-09.pcap local
		
Explore the log files; I see a number of potential canidates for items we could fire on.  Let's look a little deeper.  Take a look at the specified .bro file; what are we doing here?

		bro -r EK_Smokekt150\(Malwaredontneedcoffee\)_2012-09.pcap local ../solutions/extract-header-names-and-values.bro
		
Now let's investigate the http.log a little further.  Lets look a little closer at those http header values:

		less http.log | bro-cut server_header_names server_header_values 

This content type looks a little weird to me..

			text/html; charset=win-1251

What is that?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1251

	Windows-1251 (a.k.a. code page CP1251) is a popular 8-bit character encoding, designed to cover languages that use the Cyrillic script such as Russian, Bulgarian, Serbian Cyrillic and other languages. It is the most widely used for encoding the Bulgarian, Serbian and Macedonian languages

Is that normal for our environment?  Let's see if we can match on that.

```bro
@load base/protocols/http/main
@load base/frameworks/notice

module HTTP;
 
export {
	redef enum Notice::Type += {
		## raised once per host per 10 min
		Bad_Header
	};

	global bad_header: set[addr] &create_expire = 10 min;
}
 
event http_header(c: connection, is_orig: bool, name: string, value: string) &priority=3
  {
     if ( name == "CONTENT-TYPE" && value == "text/html; charset=win-1251" )
     {	
	 if ( c$id$orig_h !in bad_header )
	 {
		add bad_header[c$id$orig_h];
		NOTICE([$note=HTTP::Bad_Header,
		 $msg=fmt("Bad header \"%s\" seen in %s", value,c$uid),
		 $sub=name,
		 $conn=c,
		 $identifier=fmt("%s", c$id$orig_h)]);
		

		print fmt("%s :name:value:  %s:%s",c$uid,name,value);
	 }
     }
  }
```

This code is overly simple; every time we see an http header key pair this event fires.  We simply look the event and are checking specifically for the Cyrillic language.

Did you count how many times this header pair was transmitted in the sample?  Here we are thresholding the notice with a global variable called "bad header"; and we time hosts out using the **&create_expire = 10** .
    global bad_header: set[addr] &create_expire = 10 min;
    
Let's go ahead and replay the sample using our new detector.

	bro -r EK_Smokekt150\(Malwaredontneedcoffee\)_2012-09.pcap local  ../solutions/match-headers.bro 

You should now see a thresholded alert in the notice.log.

5-tbot
=================================
Malware has a purpose; many times that purpose is to generate revenue for their malware authors.

In this sample we're going to be looking at a bot whose aim is to deliver bitcoin mining traffic.

	bro -r BIN_Tbot_FC7C3E087789824F34A9309DA2388CE5_2012-12.pcap 

Do you see anything that stands out?  What appears to be going on in the http log?

Take a look at the directory **../solutions/**

	ls ../solutions/bro_bitcoin/
	json-rpc.sig  __load__.bro  mining.bro  README.rst

What do you see in the files?  The **__load__.bro** can be used to have bro load a directory.

Let's run this detection routine:

	bro -r BIN_Tbot_FC7C3E087789824F34A9309DA2388CE5_2012-12.pcap  ../solutions/bro_bitcoin/

What do you see in your notice.log
